            <b>Father of C programming language</b>
        </h2>

            <b> Dennis Ritchie</b> as we popularly know him as the <b>“Father of C programming language”</b>, was behind the scenes man who created C programming language. Born in a small town in Bronxville near New York in 1941, his father, Alistair Ritchie was a switching system engineer at the popular Bell Laboratories. When they later moved to New Jersey, Dennis graduated at Summit High School and got a bachelor’s degree from Harvard University in Physics and Applied Mathematics in 1963 and later on decided to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1968 from Harvard University. Later on, Dennis would move to MIT, where he worked alongside other scientists to develop advanced computer systems and software.
                Dennis also began working on OS for portable computers as most computers during those days would take up entire rooms to fit in and had limited access. Ritchie got helped from many of his colleagues at cracking this. They wanted to build something that could handle thousands of users at once and could be run 24*7. In doing so, Ritchie would never see programming language as a hindrance, he would rather see it as a puzzle that needed solving.
                After graduation, Ritchie had found interest in computers rather than Physics (his graduation subject) and got a job at Bell Laboratories (where his father used to work). Ritchie was quoted saying “Instead of focusing on the specific projects, I wanted to be around people who had a lot of experience and ideas. Towards that goal, I started working on various projects to learn my way around the profession.”
